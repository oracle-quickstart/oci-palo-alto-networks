# Single ARM Use Case - Reference Architecture

We are using hub-and-spoke architecture (often called as star topology), dynamic routing gateway with Palo Alto Networks VM Sereis Firewall. This architecture has a central component (the hub) that's connected to multiple networks around it, like a spoke. We are using Palo Alto Networks VM series firewall BOYL Listing from OCI Marketplace.

## Validated Version Details

We have validated v10.0.3 PAN VM Series Firewall for this architecture.

## Prerequisites

You should complete below pre-requisites before proceeding to next section:
- You have an active Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Account.
  - Tenancy OCID, User OCID, Compartment OCID, Private and Public Keys are setup properly.
- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `security-lists`,`dynamic-routing-gateways`, `subnets`, `network-load-balancers` and `instances`.
- Quota to create the following resources: 3 VCNS, 4 subnets, and 3 compute instance.

If you don't have the required permissions and quota, contact your tenancy administrator. See [Policy Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm), [Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm), [Compartment Quotas](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).


## Deployment Options

You can deploy this architecture using two approach explained in each section: 
1. Using Oracle Resource Manager 
2. Using Terraform CLI 

## Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager

In this section you will follow each steps given below to create this architecture:

1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://console.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-palo-alto-networks/raw/master/single-arm-use-case/resource-manager/pan-single-arm.zip)

    > If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan** from the stack on OCI console UI.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

    > To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then, run the **Plan** action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Apply**. 

8. At this stage your architecture should have been deployed successfully. You can proceed to next section for configuring your Palo Alto Networks VM Series Firewall.

9. If you no longer require your infrastructure, return to the Stack Details page and **Terraform Actions**, and select **Destroy**.


## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

In this section you will use **Terraform** locally to create this architecture: 


1. Create a local copy of this repo using below command on your terminal: 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-paloaltonetworks.git
    cd oci-paloaltonetworks/drg-nlb-use-case/
    ls
    ```

2. Complete the prerequisites described [here] which are associated to install **Terraform** locally:(https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-prerequisites#install-terraform).
    Make sure you have terraform v0.13+ cli installed and accessible from your terminal.

    ```bash
    terraform -v

    Terraform v0.13.0
    + provider.oci v4.14.0
    ```

3. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in your **paloaltonetworks-ha** directory, and specify the following variables:

    ```
    # Authentication
    tenancy_ocid         = "<tenancy_ocid>"
    user_ocid            = "<user_ocid>"
    fingerprint          = "<finger_print>"
    private_key_path     = "<pem_private_key_pem_file_path>"

    # SSH Keys
    ssh_public_key  = "<public_ssh_key_string_value>"

    # Region
    region = "<oci_region>"

    # Compartment
    compute_compartment_ocid = "<compartment_ocid>"
    network_compartment_ocid = "<network_compartment_ocid>"
    availability_domain_number = "<availability_domain_number>

    ````

4. Create the Resources using the following commands:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

5. At this stage your architecture should have been deployed successfully. You can proceed to next section for configuring your Palo Alto Networks VM Series Firewall. 

6. If you no longer require your infrastructure, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

## Palo Alto Networks Firewall Configuration 

This section will include necessary configuration which you need to configure to support active/active use-case. 

Once you deploy the infrastructure either using Oracle Resource Manager or Terraform CLI. We have to upload configuration on Palo Alto Networks VM series Firewall. 


> This section will be automated as Palo Alto Networks personal add bootstrap configuration using either user-data or bucket. You can follow  [Config Directory](./config-single-arm) directory for the time being to support routes, policies, interfaces config. Make sure that you update below values in xml file before you proceed to load the configuration on Firewall.

Before you proceed to next section, you should setup a admin password through CLI (Instrcutions are printed after a successful run of this code) using below commands: 

```
1.  Open an SSH client.
2.  Use the following information to connect to the instance
username: admin
IP_Address: ${oci_core_instance.ha-vms.0.public_ip}
SSH Key
For example:
$ ssh â€“i id_rsa admin@${oci_core_instance.ha-vms.0.public_ip}
3.  Set the user password for the administrator. 
    - Enter the command to go to config mode: configure
    - Change the password using command: set mgt-config users admin password
    - Save the configuration. Enter the command: commit
    - Exit from configuration mode using: Enter the command: exit

After saving the password, you should run the first time wizard in the VM Series UI:
1.  In a web browser, 
    - Connect to the VM Series UI Firewall-1: https://${oci_core_instance.ha-vms.0.public_ip}
```

Below tables shows that when you use `xml` configuration atleast you update below three values present in the file either single or multiple times based on your instance values: 

| Comment                               | Current Value in XML File | Expected Value                                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Firewall Mgmt Interface Private IP    | 192.168.0.223             | Make sure you update as per Firewall Managment Interface i.e. primary interface private IP |
| Firewall Untrust Interface Private IP   | 192.168.1.7             | Make sure you update as per Firewall Untrust Interface private IP |

## Firewall Configuration 

We have added required configuration for Palo Alto Networks Firewall [Firewall Configuration](./config-single-arm/Firewall.xml). You can use this as a reference point and upload this on your Firewall. Configuration should be same but you can compare your configuration with your Firewall Instances.

1. Connect to Firewall UI 
2. Go to Device > Operation Tab 

    ![](./images/First.png)

3. Select Import Configuration and Choose Firewall.xml file described here and update values based on the table mentioned in previous section before importing the xml file.

    ![](./images/Second.png)

    ![](./images/Third.png)

4. Now Select Load Configuration and choose file from dropdown which you just imported. 

    ![](./images/Fourth.png)

5. Verify Configuration; Interfaces, Security Policies, Default Routes, Address Objects.
6. Commit your changes


Once you commit your change you won't be able to use your previously set admin password, you should use `admin/Admin@123` login details to UI now. 

At some point you will need to enable jumbo frame you can do this using below steps: 
1. Connect to Firewall UI 
2. Select Device > Session > Setting > Setting button 
3. Check jumbo frame icon. 

We are using `HTTPS` healthprobe configuration on each interfaces to make sure they are healthy behind NLBs. This is included in XML configuration. 


## Some Useful Configuration Pics on Palo Alto Networks Firewall 

I am attaching some sample configuration from one of the Firewall-B for your reference as below: 

1. Interfaces Configuration 
    - Ethernet1/1 ; Untrust Interface 

![](./images/interfaces.png)

2. Security Policies 
    - Allow All: For Test purpose only in production env make sure you add policy which are needed.

![](./images/FirewallB_Policies.png)

3. Default Routes Configuration 
    - Default route via untrust interface gateway (eth1/1)
    - Static Routes for Spoke VCNs via trust interface gateway (eth1/1)

![](./images/FirewallB_Routes.png)

4. Jumbo Frame Configuration 
    - End user need to enable this manually and restart each firewall VM afterwards. 
    - Below image shows where you need to go to enable jumbo frame.
