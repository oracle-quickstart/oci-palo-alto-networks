# Palo Alto Networks VM Series Firewall - Reference Architecture

We are using hub-and-spoke network (often called star topology) has a central component (the hub) that's connected to multiple networks around it, like a wheel. Implementing this topology in the traditional data center can be costly. But in the Oracle Cloud, thereâ€™s no extra cost.

For details of the architecture, see [_Set up a hub-and-spoke network topology_](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/hub-spoke-network/index.html).

## Prerequisites

- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `security-lists`, `local-peering-gateways`, `subnets`, and `instances`.

- Quota to create the following resources: 3 VCNS, 3 subnets, and 1 compute instance.

If you don't have the required permissions and quota, contact your tenancy administrator. See [Policy Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Reference/policyreference.htm), [Service Limits](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm), [Compartment Quotas](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcequotas.htm).

## Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager

1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://console.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-paloaltonetworks/raw/pan-reference-architecture/paloaltonetworks-ha/resource-manager/pan-ha.zip)

    If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan**.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

    To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then, run the **Plan** action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Apply**. 


## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

### Clone the Module
Create a local copy of this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-paloaltonetworks.git
    cd oci-paloaltonetworks
    git checkout pan-reference-architecture  ## This will be updated.
    ls

### Set Up and Configure Terraform

1. Complete the prerequisites described [here](https://github.com/cloud-partners/oci-prerequisites).

2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file, and specify the following variables:

    ```
    # Authentication
    tenancy_ocid         = "<tenancy_ocid>"
    user_ocid            = "<user_ocid>"
    fingerprint          = "<finger_print>"
    private_key_path     = "<pem_private_key_path>"

    # SSH Keys
    ssh_public_key  = "<public_ssh_key_path>"

    # Region
    region = "<oci_region>"

    # Compartment
    compute_compartment_ocid = "<compartment_ocid>"
    network_compartment_ocid = "<network_compartment_ocid>"
    availability_domain_number = "<availability_domain_number>

    ````

### Create the Resources
Run the following commands:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply

### Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

    terraform destroy

## Palo Alto Networks Firewall Configuration 

This section will include necessary configuration which you need to configure to support HA (active/passive) use-case. 

> This section will be updated. You can follow config-ha directory for the time being to support routes, policies, interfaces, HA config.
